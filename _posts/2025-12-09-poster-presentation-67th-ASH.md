I’m honoured to receive ASH Abstract Achievement Award for my poster presented at the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in Orlando, Florida. In ourcwork, we explored how aging influences alcohol-induced inflammation and promotes sustained upregulation of transposable elements in aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Notably, these changes are linked to a significant increased chromatin accesibility of retroelement–associated genomic loci in aged HSCs, shedding light on how aging and alcohol together reshapes stem cell chromatin (epigenome) landscapes. The abstract is now published in _Blood_ journal (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2025-1378)
