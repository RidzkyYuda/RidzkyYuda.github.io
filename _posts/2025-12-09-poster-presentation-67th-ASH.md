My abstract was selected for a poster presentation at the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in Orlando, Florida, where I received an ASH Abstract Achievement Award. In this poster, I presented findings on how aging modulates alcohol-induced inflammation and sustains transposable element upregulation in aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These changes were associated with a pronounced re-opening of transposable element–linked genomic loci in aged HSCs.
