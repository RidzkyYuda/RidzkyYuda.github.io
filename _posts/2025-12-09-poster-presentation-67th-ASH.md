I’m excited to share my poster presented at the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in Orlando, Florida. In my work, I explored how aging influences alcohol-induced inflammation and promotes sustained upregulation of transposable elements in aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Notably, these changes are linked to a significant re-opening of transposable element–associated genomic loci in aged HSCs, shedding light on how aging and alcohol together reshapes stem cell chromatin landscapes. The abstract is published in _Blood_ journal (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2025-1378)
