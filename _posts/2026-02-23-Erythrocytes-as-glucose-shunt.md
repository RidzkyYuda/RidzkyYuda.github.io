Epidemiological studies have reported an inverse correlation between living at high altitude and the prevalence of diabetes. High-altitude environments expose residents to multiple environmental stressors, including reduced oxygen availability, increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and lower temperatures. However, the mechanisms underlying the lower incidence of diabetes among high-altitude populations have remained unclear.
In a recent study published in Cell Metabolism, a research group led by Isha Jain at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) uncovered a potential explanation. The team demonstrated that erythrocytes function as a glucose “shunt” during hypoxia-induced hypoglycemia. Using C57BL/6J mice housed under normoxic (21% O₂) or hypoxic (8% O₂) conditions for 14 days, the researchers observed significantly lower blood glucose levels in mice exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 1A). Moreover, hypoxic mice displayed improved glucose tolerance, and this metabolic benefit persisted for months after the animals were returned to normoxic conditions (Fig. 1B). Notably, this phenotype did not depend on enhanced insulin signaling but instead appeared to result from a systemic physiological adaptation.
Erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in the body and rely primarily on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) glycolytic pathway due to their lack of mitochondria. Because hypoxic exposure increases both erythrocyte numbers and their glycolytic activity, the researchers hypothesized that erythrocytes may act as a glucose sink during hypoxia.
To test this, the team performed serial phlebotomy every three days to induce anemia—thereby reducing erythrocyte numbers—in both normoxic and hypoxic mice. By withdrawing up to 15% of total blood volume (TBV), they asked whether decreasing erythrocyte abundance would attenuate the hypoxia-induced reduction in blood glucose levels. Indeed, repetitive blood withdrawal blunted the hypoglycemic effect and reversed glucose tolerance observed in hypoxia-exposed mice. Importantly, this intervention did not significantly alter other hematological parameters aside from erythrocyte counts, supporting the idea that increased erythrocyte abundance contributes directly to systemic glucose lowering.
Next, the team performed an elegant red blood cell (RBC) transfusion experiment, transferring erythrocytes isolated from either hypoxic- or normoxic-housed mice into recipient animals to further dissect the causal role of elevated erythrocytes in mediating this metabolic adaptation. Interestingly, both transfusion groups exhibited hypoglycemia with slightly greater effect was observed in mice receiving hypoxic RBCs, suggesting not only the increased RBCs but also cell-intrinsic phenotypic changes in hypoxic RBCs. Radioactive tracing experiment using carbon 13-labelled 2-deoxy-D-glucose (U-13C) [2DG (U-13C)], revealed increased uptake of 2UDG molecule by hypoxic erythrocytes, which is also being corroborated by increased glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 and 4. This absorbed glucose within erythrocytes were fluxed into glycolysis by the presence of hypoxia condition. 
Finally, the team also tested the translational implications of the hypoxia-induced glucose uptake in erythrocytes by performing several elegant experiments. First, they tested whether hypoxia can reduce hyperglicemic condition in diabetic mice induced by streptozotoxin (STZ). STZ-induced diabetic mice showed erythrocytosis and concomitant reduction of blood glucose level, as well as increased glucose tolerance after being exposed to hypoxic condition. Second, they also performed RBC transfusion experiment a kin to cell therapy model into STZ-induced diabetic mice and found that diabetic mice receiving hypoxic RBC developed less hyperglycemia. Lastly, the authors utilized a small molecule called HypoxyStat that reduce oxygen offloading into tissue whereby inducing local tissue hypoxia. Interestingly, HypoxyStat treatment reduced hyperglycemia in mice fed with high fat diet (HFD). 
Overall, this study establishes the importance of hypoxia-induced erythrocytosis in reducing blood glucose levels explaining the correlation between living in high altitude with reduced diabetic incident. Nevertheless, this study has some limitations owing to the use of C57BL6/J strain that has known inherent glucose tolerant, and assessment with other strains warrant future studies. Importantly, aging also reduces RBC production and it would be interesting to see the effect of age in the phenotype given diabetes are more prevalence with the increasing age. Furthermore, the study did not address the mechanisms underlying glucose transporter expression in RBC born in hypoxic condition which could be originated to the changes in erythrocyte progenitor cells such as erythroid.
