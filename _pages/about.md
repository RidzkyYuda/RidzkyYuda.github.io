I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Division of Hematology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. As a stem cell biologist, I am intrigued by the process of how stem cells balance self-renewal and differentiation, and when that mechanisms get disrupted culminating into age-related degenerative diseases and cancers. My research aims to understand cellular and molecular (transcriptome and epigenome) mechanisms governing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions and macrophage self-renewal in the context of inflammation and aging.

During my Ph.D. training in Prof. Michael Sieweke’s lab at Technische Universität Dresden, I contributed to demonstrating that alveolar macrophages—a tissue-resident macrophage population in the lung—can undergo extensive self-renewal in culture without losing core cellular identity, and that they can be genetically engineered using lentiviral vectors.

In my current postdoctoral research project, I integrate chronic alcohol feeding, LPS inflammation model and bone marrow reconstitution with single-cell multi-omics (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq) to elucidate molecular mechanism underlying altered HSC commitment. I found that increased myeloid bias following alcohol drinking is associated with the activation of inflammatory and aging gene expression program, as well as epigenetic derepression of repetitive elements at the distal intergenic regions (Yuda et al., 2025, bioRxiv). For this work, I am supported by a prestigious postdoctoral fellowship award from the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund (MSCRF). 

Overall, my primary expertise is in experimental hematology equipped with capability to do bioinformatic analysis independently. To find out more about my research and publications, feel free to visit my blog website here https://ridzkyyuda.github.io/
