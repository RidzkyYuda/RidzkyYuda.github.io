## Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub AcademicPages site. I created this platform to share my research portfolio, technical expertise, and ongoing projects, and to connect with collaborators across academia and industry. When time permits, I also write short posts that translate recent advances in stem cell biology and immunology into accessible language.

Below is a brief overview of my background and research focus.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Hematology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. My work aims to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell fate decisions and to understand how their disruption contributes to aging-associated dysfunction and hematologic disease. I focus particularly on how inflammatory stress reshapes hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) commitment and tissue-resident macrophage self-renewal.

My research integrates in vivo disease modeling with single-cell multi-omics approaches, including scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, to resolve transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory programs at cellular resolution. I design and execute murine models such as chronic alcohol exposure, LPS-induced inflammation, and bone marrow reconstitution, and I independently develop computational pipelines to analyze and interpret high-dimensional datasets.

During my Ph.D. training in the laboratory of Prof. Michael Sieweke at Technische Universität Dresden, I contributed in a collaborative study accross Franco-German institutions to demonstrating that alveolar macrophages—a lung-resident macrophage population—can undergo extensive self-renewal in vitro while maintaining core cellular identity. We further established methods to genetically engineer these cells using lentiviral vectors, expanding their utility for mechanistic and functional studies.

In my current postdoctoral project, I investigate how chronic inflammatory stress alters HSC lineage commitme
