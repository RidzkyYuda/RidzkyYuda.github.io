Research Interest
=====

My research focuses on understanding how cellular and molecular mechanisms, including transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, govern hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions and macrophage self-renewal in the context of inflammation and aging. I combine in vivo mouse models, molecular biology, and bulk and single-cell omics to investigate how environmental exposures and aging influence stem cell lineage commitment. I am particularly interested in how epigenetic regulators and transposable elements shape hematopoiesis via immune signaling. My long-term goal is to define and test candidate pathways using high-throughput gain- and loss-of-function approaches to rejuvenate aging stem cell and macrophage function.
